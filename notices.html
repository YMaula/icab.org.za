		On the 6th of September 2024, Mufti Menk visited our Musallah, delivering a profound Jummah lecture on "The BIGGEST Hypocrite" and leading the congregation in prayer. 
		His sermon emphasized the dangers of hypocrisy, urging us to reflect on our actions and intentions. 
		He highlighted the importance of sincerity and authenticity, reminding us that true faith goes beyond outward expressions. 
		With thought-provoking examples and heartfelt anecdotes, Mufti Menk's words deeply resonated with everyone, leaving a lasting impression. 
		It was a powerful call to elevate our spiritual consciousness and align our lives with the principles of our faith.</p>

		<h2>The Musjid Project</h2>
		<p>The Bedfordview Musjid Project is set to commence shortly, Inshaallah. This marks a significant milestone for our community as we embark on the construction of a new musjid that will serve as a beacon of faith, unity, and support for all. 
		This sacred endeavor will be funded entirely through Lillah contributions, ensuring that every bit of support goes directly into creating a space that fosters spiritual growth, community bonding, and charitable outreach.
		Our vision is to build not just a place of worship, but a hub for communal activities, educational programs, and social services. This project will be a testament to our collective dedication and commitment to preserving and nurturing our faith for future generations. We invite everyone to be a part of this historic journey, contributing in any way they can, whether through donations, volunteering, or spreading the word.
		Stay tuned for more updates on our progress and how you can get involved. Let us come together in this noble cause and build a sanctuary that stands as a symbol of our shared values and aspirations. May Allah bless this endeavor and all those who support it</p>
